# Verification

Live gateway checks are required because a valid model id in source code does not prove that the model is currently available or that the gateway path works.

## Required Checks

### User names or changes a model

Send the message `hi` through the exact model using:

- `CUSTOMWARE_AI_GATEWAY_KEY` from the server environment
- the real org id
- the real project id
- the fixed Customware gateway base URL
- the same reasoning configuration the feature will use

Do this before finishing implementation. A successful HTTP response with generated text is a pass.

### Feature generates JSON

Run the one-key `{ "status": "ok" }` check from [structured-output.md](structured-output.md) with the exact selected model. The returned AI SDK `output` must pass the Zod schema.

### Chat feature

Exercise the generated app's Hono endpoint with at least two user turns so the second request includes prior messages. Confirm both responses stream and the assistant uses the prior turn.

## How To Run Checks

Create a temporary TypeScript script inside the target project's ignored `tmp/` directory so it resolves the project's installed packages. Use `createOpenRouter`, the fixed gateway URL, and the same model config as the implementation.

Use this shape and replace the ids before running it:

```ts
import { createOpenRouter, type OpenRouterProviderOptions } from "@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider";
import { generateText, Output } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";

const orgId = "<real Customware org id>";
const projectId = "<real Customware project id>";
const modelId = process.argv[2] ?? "google/gemini-3-flash-preview";
const apiKey = process.env.CUSTOMWARE_AI_GATEWAY_KEY;

if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error("CUSTOMWARE_AI_GATEWAY_KEY is required.");
}

const customwareAI = createOpenRouter({
  apiKey,
  baseURL: `https://app.customware.ai/api/orgs/${orgId}/projects/${projectId}/ai/v1`,
});

const providerOptions: { openrouter: OpenRouterProviderOptions } | undefined =
  modelId === "openai/gpt-5.6-luna" || modelId === "openai/gpt-5.6-terra"
    ? { openrouter: { reasoning: { effort: "high" } } }
    : undefined;

const textResult = await generateText({
  model: customwareAI(modelId),
  providerOptions,
  prompt: "hi",
});

console.log({
  check: "text",
  modelId,
  response: textResult.text,
  passed: textResult.text.trim().length > 0,
});

if (process.argv.includes("--json")) {
  const { output } = await generateText({
    model: customwareAI(modelId),
    providerOptions,
    output: Output.object({
      schema: z.object({ status: z.literal("ok") }),
    }),
    prompt: 'Return exactly one JSON field named "status" with the value "ok".',
  });

  console.log({
    check: "structured-output",
    modelId,
    output,
    passed: output.status === "ok",
  });
}
```

Run TypeScript natively with the environment source used by the target app. For a local `.env`:

```bash
node --env-file=.env --experimental-strip-types tmp/customware-ai-smoke.ts google/gemini-3-flash-preview
node --env-file=.env --experimental-strip-types tmp/customware-ai-smoke.ts google/gemini-3-flash-preview --json
```

If the sandbox already injects system environment values, omit `--env-file=.env`. Remove the temporary script after verification unless the user explicitly asks to keep it.

## Evidence And Failure Rules

- Log the model id, check name, response text or parsed output, and pass/fail result.
- Never log the gateway key, authorization header, provider configuration containing the key, or full sensitive prompts.
- Do not claim a model or JSON path was tested unless a live gateway call completed.
- Do not silently retry through OpenRouter directly.
- Do not silently switch models.
- If the `hi` check fails, report that exact model and failure.
- If the JSON check fails after text succeeds, report structured output as the failing capability.
- After live checks, run the target app's normal check and build commands.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Gateway called only from Hono/server code.
- [ ] `CUSTOMWARE_AI_GATEWAY_KEY` remains server-only.
- [ ] Fixed URL contains the real org and project ids.
- [ ] Exact requested/default model used.
- [ ] User-named model passed the live `hi` check.
- [ ] JSON feature passed the one-key structured-output check.
- [ ] Multi-turn chat was exercised when chat was built.
- [ ] App check/build completed.
